# MicGuard — Architecture

**Status:** ✅ Current — describes the shipped v1.x app
**Last Updated:** 2026-07-12

## Overview

MicGuard is a single-process Windows tray app that pins the default capture
device and its recording volume. Windows and games (Black Ops 3 was the
original offender) silently change both; MicGuard subscribes to Core Audio
change events and re-asserts the configured state within ~50 ms (measured).
It is deliberately tiny: **one source file (`micguard.py`, ~600 lines), stdlib
+ 4 runtime deps, compiled to a single unsigned exe** that friends run with
zero setup. There is no server, no database, no installer, no Task Scheduler —
a JSON config, a log file, and one `HKCU\...\Run` registry value.

## Stack

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Language | Python 3.13 (`requires-python >=3.11`) | What the repo grew up in; `dict \| dict` merge and `str \| None` syntax are used, hence the 3.11 floor |
| Audio API | **pycaw** + **comtypes** | The only maintained Python bindings to Windows Core Audio (`IMMDeviceEnumerator`, `IAudioEndpointVolume`, event callbacks). Replaced the old `nircmd.exe` shell-outs — direct COM calls are ~instant and give us *callbacks* instead of polling |
| Set-default-device | `IPolicyConfig` COM interface, hand-declared in `micguard.py` | Windows has **no public API** to set the default audio device. This undocumented-but-stable-since-Win7 interface is what SoundSwitch/EarTrumpet use. Only `SetDefaultEndpoint` is called; earlier vtable slots are placeholder `COMMETHOD`s (slot *count* must stay exact — see Gotchas) |
| Tray icon | **pystray** (+ **Pillow** to draw the mic glyph) | De-facto standard, ctypes-based on Windows (no pywin32 dependency), runs its own message loop |
| Settings/dialog UI | **tkinter** (stdlib) | Ships inside the PyInstaller exe for free; a settings window and yes/no dialogs don't justify a UI framework |
| Config | JSON at `%APPDATA%\MicGuard\config.json` (stdlib `json`) | Human-readable, trivially merged with defaults on load |
| Startup | `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` via stdlib `winreg` | Per-user, no admin, no Task Scheduler — an explicit product requirement |
| Updates | GitHub Releases API via stdlib `urllib` | No `requests` dependency for one GET; latest-release tag compared to `VERSION` |
| Packaging | **PyInstaller** `--onefile --noconsole`, driven by **uv** | Single `MicGuard.exe` (~19.6 MB) on the Releases page; `uv` manages the venv/lockfile per the standing tooling rule |

**Deliberate non-picks** (vs [Preferred-Stack.md](Preferred-Stack.md)): no
Pydantic/whenever/Tenacity/icecream. Every dependency inflates the onefile exe
and this app has no timezone math, no schema boundary, and one retry-able
network call. Stdlib-first is the rule here (see AI-Development-Guide Rule 1).
`uv` + the handpicked-libraries rule apply in full.

Runtime footprint on a user's machine:

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `%APPDATA%\MicGuard\config.json` | settings (see [Dynamic-Settings.md](Dynamic-Settings.md)) |
| `%APPDATA%\MicGuard\micguard.log` | INFO-level log; the only debugging surface on a friend's PC |
| `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\MicGuard\MicGuard.exe` | suggested install location (any path works) |
| `HKCU\...\Run\MicGuard` | startup entry, only when the setting is on |

## Threads & event flow (the whole design)

`micguard.py` sections top-to-bottom: Core Audio plumbing → event callbacks →
config/registry/update/uninstall helpers → `Enforcer` → `App` (tray + settings)
→ `main()`.

```
main()                                   [main thread]
 ├─ already_running()?  → exit (named mutex "Local\MicGuardSingleton")
 ├─ App() — first run: autodetect_device() picks the mic that is BOTH
 │          default + default-comms (fallback: multimedia default → first
 │          active capture device), volume prefilled from current level
 └─ app.run() → pystray Icon.run()  ← owns the main thread forever

Enforcer (threading.Thread, daemon)      [the ONLY thread doing COM work]
 ├─ comtypes.CoInitialize()
 ├─ registers _DeviceCallback  (IMMNotificationClient: default-device /
 │                              device-state changes)
 ├─ registers _VolumeCallback  (IAudioEndpointVolumeCallback on the target mic)
 └─ loop: wake.get(timeout=15)   # 15 s watchdog is the only "polling"
     └─ _enforce():
         1. any of the 3 roles (console/multimedia/comms) drifted?
            → IPolicyConfig.SetDefaultEndpoint(device_id, each role)
         2. |current − target| > 0.005? → SetMasterVolumeLevelScalar
         3. muted? → unmute

Callbacks (arrive on arbitrary COM threads)
 └─ do NOTHING but wake.put("volume"|"default"|"state")   ← hard rule

UI threads (spawned per action from tray menu)
 ├─ settings window: new thread → CoInitialize → tkinter mainloop
 │   (lock `_settings_open` makes it single-instance)
 └─ update check / uninstall: new thread → tkinter dialogs
```

**The enforcement loop in words:** anything that touches the mic fires a COM
callback → the callback drops a token on `Enforcer.wake` (a `queue.Queue`) →
the enforcer drains the burst, re-asserts device + volume + mute, and goes
back to sleep. Our own corrective `SetMasterVolumeLevelScalar` fires the
callback again, but the next `_enforce` pass is a no-op because the value now
matches — that's the recursion guard. A 15-second `queue.get` timeout doubles
as a watchdog pass for any missed event; that one COM read is the app's entire
idle cost.

**Update flow (user-consented, never silent):** on launch (if
`check_updates`) and via tray → *Check for updates*: fetch
`releases/latest` → newer tag? → **yes/no dialog**. Accept → download the
`.exe` asset to `%APPDATA%\MicGuard\MicGuard.new.exe`, spawn `update.bat`
(wait-loop → `copy /y` over `sys.executable` → restart → self-delete), quit.
Any failure → info dialog with the releases URL + `webbrowser.open` so the
user can download manually. Version comparison is `parse_version` on
`VERSION = "x.y.z"` — the single source of truth that `release.ps1` bumps.

**Uninstall flow:** tray → *Uninstall…* → confirm dialog → delete Run key +
`%APPDATA%\MicGuard` → trampoline bat deletes the exe after exit.

## Gotchas (each one cost real debugging time)

- **Every thread that touches COM calls `comtypes.CoInitialize()` first.**
  The settings window enumerates devices on its own thread — forgetting this
  produced `WinError -2147221008 CoInitialize has not been called` (fixed
  2026-07-12). The Enforcer owns all long-lived COM objects; nothing else
  holds one across threads.
- **`IPolicyConfig._methods_` slot count is load-bearing.** The placeholder
  `COMMETHOD`s exist only to pad the vtable so `SetDefaultEndpoint` lands at
  slot 11 (after `ResetDeviceFormat` — the Win7+ layout, not the Vista one).
  Add/remove a line and you corrupt the call. Never call the placeholders.
- **Callbacks must not do COM work or block** — they arrive on COM's threads;
  re-entering the audio API there can deadlock. Queue-poke only.
- **PyInstaller onefile shows two `MicGuard.exe` processes** (bootstrap +
  child). Not a bug; `Stop-Process -Name MicGuard` kills both.
- **tkinter runs fine off the main thread** (pystray owns main) as long as a
  given `Tk()` instance is created, used, and destroyed on ONE thread. Each
  dialog/window builds a fresh `Tk()`.
- **`DEFAULT_CONFIG | json.load(f)`** in `load_config` is the config migration
  mechanism: new keys added to `DEFAULT_CONFIG` just work for old installs.
- The exe is **unsigned** → SmartScreen warning on friends' PCs (documented in
  README). Signing is a known open gap.

## Honest gaps

- **No test suite.** Verification is the manual smoke commands in
  [AI-Development-Guide.md](AI-Development-Guide.md) §6 plus the human backlog
  in [Verify/2026_07-12_Verification-Backlog.md](Verify/2026_07-12_Verification-Backlog.md).
  Core Audio behavior is hard to unit-test; a fake-`AudioUtilities` seam would
  be the starting point if tests are ever added.
- **No ruff config yet** — the standing Astral-toolchain preference applies,
  but `[tool.ruff]` hasn't been added to `pyproject.toml`.
- `.myArchive/` and `.history/` are untracked local-only history; the GitHub
  repo starts at the v1.0.0 rewrite (`4bda0ee`).
